# Ruby: Terminal IO

## 3 ways to print something
- **puts:** print the contents, returns nil, adds newliine at end. It attempts to convert everything to strint (to_s), so nil becomes ""
- **print:** print the contents, returns nil
- **p:** print the contents, returns the object itself
- **pp:** Same as p, but prints arrays and hashes in a nicer way.
